#### Description:
This program uses `HTML` and `CSS` to allow users re-implement a front end for Google’s homepage.

* Google Search: The user can type in a query, click “Google Search”, and be taken to the Google search results for that page.
* Google Image Search: The user can type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.
* Google Advance Search: The user can provide input for the following four fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options)
  * Find pages with… “all these words:”
  * Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
  * Find pages with… “any of these words:”
  * Find pages with… “none of these words:”
* I'm Feeling Lucky: The user can click this link to directly navigate to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page
